{"name":"xgminer-osx","tagline":"Shell scripts for creating redistributable packages of cgminer and bfgminer for Mac OS X","body":"This project consists of a standard set of shell scripts for creating redistributable packages of [cgminer][6] and [bfgminer][7] for Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n![bfgminer](http://nwoolls.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-01-at-5-47-22-pm.png \"bfgminer\")\r\n\r\nThe [Releases][8] page is used to provide binary downloads for these redistributable packages. All source code comes from official sources.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between:\r\n\r\n* John - author of [MacMiner][5]\r\n* [Kerry][3] - author of [Asteroid][4]\r\n* [Nate Woolls][1] - author of [MultiMiner][2]\r\n\r\nOur aim is to provide a single source for the best possible OS X binaries for cgminer and bfgminer until such time as the authors provide OS X redistributables themselves.\r\n\r\nHomebrew\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIf you are a [Homebrew][10] user and are interested in using Homebrew to install cgminer and/or bfgminer, the [homebrew-xgminer][9] repository contains formulas and instructions that make this a simple process.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.nwoolls.com/\r\n[2]: http://multiminerapp.com\r\n[3]: http://www.spaceman.ca/blog/\r\n[4]: http://www.asteroidapp.com/\r\n[5]: http://fabulouspanda.co.uk/macminer/\r\n[6]: https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer\r\n[7]: https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer\r\n[8]: https://github.com/nwoolls/xgminer-osx/releases\r\n[9]: http://homebrew.xgminer.com\r\n[10]: http://brew.sh/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
