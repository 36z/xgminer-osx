xgminer-osx
===========

This project consists of a standard set of shell scripts for creating redistributable packages of [cgminer][6] and [bfgminer][7] for Mac OS X.

The Releases tab will be used to provide downloads for these redistributable packages. All source code comes from official sources.

This project is a collaboration between:

* John - author of [MacMiner][5]
* [Kerry][3] - author of [Asteroid][4]
* [Nate Woolls][1] - author of [MultiMiner][2]

[6]: https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer
[7]: https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer

Our aim is to provide a single source for the best possible OS X binaries for cgminer and bfgminer until such time as the authors provide OS X redistributables themselves.
